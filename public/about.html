<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Software Project manager with a background in Data and with interest in understanding how to code. I have 
  already learned some coding languages like C++ and Python on an Intro level.
</p>

<p>I am starting with learning the basics of Web Development through <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/" target="_blank"">this course</a>
in hopes to gain better insight into how websites are built. This is only the first step though.
</p>

<p>I have aspirations for learning everything from Web Development and App Development to backend devlopment 
and database tools and everything inbetween, around and beyond.
